## Hi there 👋

This project was developed by National Cancer Centre Singapore Department of Radiation Oncology Physics for use in determining imaging dose to the patient in the Varian TrueBeam kV Imaging system.

It is currently still a work in progress but you are welcomed to take a look, contribute and collaborate with us on improving this tool. The current iteration of this project consist of a python script that wraps around TOPASMC and Geant4 and is targeted for end users who might not be as savvy in setting up a Monte Carlo simulation. The project was initially conceived as a study on imaging dose during kV imaging set ups on our patients, eventaully this GUI was spun off to create a simple user friendly application to determine imaging dose. To do so, we have obscure the bulk of the code behind the user interface and streamlined the visible parameters to just the most commonly used ones. The GUI aims to be a user friend point and click interface with a limited number of input fields and parameters to make it as accessible as possible. 

If you are interested in the imaging dose to a patient during imaging set up, this could be a great tool for you.
